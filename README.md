# CSSI_KIR

This was a final group project created at Google CSSI in Kirkland, Washington. We developed an app with the goal to connect students on college campuses using map, email, and calendar integration (Google Maps, Gmail, and Google Calendar APIs respectively). This platform would give users the ability to create events with certain tags (like class names, times, locations, etc.) so that other users could view and join these events. All users would then receive an email and calendar invite for the event. This application was also made to integrate group messaging, having "friends," and joining classes. While this app is unfinished and has a substantial amount of bugs, I hope to be able to continue working on this app and eventually propose it to Purdue University for use across campus...
